# Service Call History Logger - Professional Test Cases

## Test Suite: Service Call History Logging System

### Test Case 1: Basic Logging Functionality
**Objective**: Verify that service calls are properly logged and persisted

**Test Steps**:
1. Initialize HistoryLogger instance
2. Call `logCall()` with valid service call data
3. Verify call ID is returned
4. Check that log entry exists in storage
5. Verify log entry contains all required fields

**Expected Results**:
- Unique call ID returned (format: `call_timestamp_randomid`)
- Log entry persists in `data/service-history.json`
- All fields properly populated: id, service, action, status, runId, timestamp, parameters

**Test Data**:
```javascript
const testCall = {
  service: 'huhu',
  action: 'generate',
  status: 'pending',
  runId: 'test_run_123',
  parameters: {
    model_image: 'https://example.com/model.png',
    top_garment: 'https://example.com/top.jpg'
  }
};
```

### Test Case 2: Status Updates
**Objective**: Verify that logged calls can be updated with success/error status

**Test Steps**:
1. Log initial service call with 'pending' status
2. Call `markSuccess()` with result path and duration
3. Verify status updated to 'success'
4. Call `markError()` on another call with error message
5. Verify status updated to 'error'

**Expected Results**:
- Status properly updated in storage
- Success calls include resultPath and duration
- Error calls include error message and duration
- Timestamp remains unchanged

### Test Case 3: Persistence Across Server Restarts
**Objective**: Verify that logged calls persist between application restarts

**Test Steps**:
1. Log multiple service calls
2. Restart the application/server
3. Initialize new HistoryLogger instance
4. Verify all previously logged calls are loaded

**Expected Results**:
- All logged calls loaded from `data/service-history.json`
- Date objects properly reconstructed from ISO strings
- No data loss during restart

### Test Case 4: Query Operations
**Objective**: Verify all query methods work correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Log calls for different services (huhu, fashn, fitroom)
2. Log calls for different run IDs
3. Test `getAllCalls()` returns all logs
4. Test `getCallsForRun()` filters by run ID
5. Test `getCallsForService()` filters by service
6. Test `searchCalls()` with various query terms

**Expected Results**:
- Each query method returns correct subset of data
- No false positives or missing results
- Search functionality works on service, action, and run ID

### Test Case 5: Statistics Generation
**Objective**: Verify statistics are calculated correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Create test dataset with mixed success/error calls
2. Generate statistics using `getStats()`
3. Verify success rate calculation
4. Verify average duration calculation
5. Verify service breakdown counts

**Expected Results**:
- Success rate = (success calls / total calls) * 100
- Average duration calculated only from calls with duration
- Service breakdown accurately counts calls per service

### Test Case 6: Storage Management
**Objective**: Verify storage limits and cleanup work correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Create 1100 test calls (exceeding 1000 limit)
2. Verify oldest calls are removed to maintain limit
3. Create calls with old timestamps
4. Call `clearOldLogs(1)` to remove calls older than 1 day
5. Verify only recent calls remain

**Expected Results**:
- Log count never exceeds MAX_LOGS (1000)
- Old logs properly removed by date
- Storage file size remains manageable

### Test Case 7: Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling for various failure scenarios

**Test Steps**:
1. Test with corrupted storage file
2. Test with insufficient disk space (mock)
3. Test with invalid service call data
4. Test concurrent access scenarios

**Expected Results**:
- Graceful fallback to empty array for corrupted data
- Appropriate error logging for failures
- No application crashes or data corruption

### Test Case 8: Integration Test with Service Managers
**Objective**: Verify end-to-end logging integration with actual service managers

**Test Steps**:
1. Execute HuHu service generation
2. Verify logging call is made with correct parameters
3. Verify status updates during processing
4. Verify final success/error status is recorded
5. Check History API returns the logged data

**Expected Results**:
- Service call logged at start with 'pending' status
- Status updated to 'success' with duration and result path
- History API returns the logged call data
- No discrepancy between logged data and API response

### Test Case 9: Concurrent Logging
**Objective**: Verify system handles multiple simultaneous logging operations

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate multiple service calls executing simultaneously
2. Verify all calls are logged correctly
3. Check for race conditions or data corruption
4. Verify file locking prevents conflicts

**Expected Results**:
- All concurrent calls properly logged
- No data loss or corruption
- File operations are atomic and safe

### Test Case 10: Performance Testing
**Objective**: Verify logging system performance under load

**Test Steps**:
1. Log 1000 service calls rapidly
2. Measure logging performance per operation
3. Verify memory usage remains stable
4. Test query performance with large datasets

**Expected Results**:
- Logging operations complete in < 10ms each
- Memory usage grows linearly with log count
- Query operations complete in < 100ms
- File I/O operations are efficient
